              Along with the new entities and the regular information updates, The <em>World Factbook</em> now also features six new fields. In the <strong>Economy</strong> category, entries have been added for <em>Current account balance</em>, <em>Investment (gross fixed)</em>, <em>Public debt</em>, and <em>Reserves of foreign exchange and gold</em>. The <strong>Transnational issues</strong> category has a new <em>Refugees and internally displaced persons</em> entry. Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in the 2001 edition, is continued in this edition. Several regional maps have also been updated to reflect boundary changes and place name spelling changes.</p>

If income were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100.</td>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine species (by-catch) by its effect of "sweeping the ocean clean."<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of organisms and their specific environments.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it.<br>            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.<br>              
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greenhouse gas - a gas that "traps" infrared radiation in the lower atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source for wells and natural springs.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders economic resources.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 145,000 Inuits of Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science, technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of ground water and air when not properly disposed.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O<sub>3</sub>) that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living organisms.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with respect to endangered or threatened species.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made waste.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the environment .<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce agricultural products.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind, compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing, and desertification.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water-born diseases - those in which the bacteria survive in, and is transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an untreated water supply.</td>

The PPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy.&nbsp; The data derived from the PPP method provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries.&nbsp; The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.&nbsp; Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations.&nbsp; Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In contrast, the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output. In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One important caution:&nbsp; the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data <i>can</i><i>not </i>be chained together from successive volumes of the <i>Factbook</i> because of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of information, and changes in national statistical methods and practices.</td>

Definitions of the major governmental terms are as follows:<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought about by the absence of governmental authority.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communism - a system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people (i.e., a classless society).<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority over all matters except those delegated to the central government.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of that government. <br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitutional Democracy - a form of government in which the sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution.<br>              &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitutional Monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Democratic Republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal (Federative) - a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a central authority and a number of constituent regions (states, colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as upon the regional units.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal Republic - a state in which the powers of the central government are restricted and in which the component parts (states, colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental representatives.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch with the people.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by 19<sup>th</sup> century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists (business owners), to a socialist "dictatorship of the proletariat," to, finally, a classless society - communism.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed to underdeveloped countries.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with constitutionally limited authority.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small group of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parliamentary Democracy - a political system in which the legislature (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the parliament.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parliamentary Government (Cabinet-Parliamentary Government) - a government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer function.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parliamentary Monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity); true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a legislature (parliament).<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on legislation.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Socialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and distributing goods is controlled by a central government that theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state); the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government subject to religious authority.<br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters, but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.</td>

The UN established the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to handle refugee matters worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has a different, operational definition for a Palestinian refugee: "a person whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict." However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000 Palestinian refugees not covered under the UNRWA definition. The term "internally displaced person" is not specifically covered in the UN Convention; it is used to describe people who have fled their homes for reasons similar to refugees, but who remain within their own national territory and are subject to the laws of that state. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that in December 2003 there was a global population of 9.7 million refugees and as many as 25 million IDPs.</td>

PanAmSat - PanAmSat Corporation (Greenwich, CT).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAFE - South African Far East Cable<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; satellite communication system - a communication system consisting of two or more earth stations and at least one satellite that provide long distance transmission of voice, data, and television; the system usually serves as a trunk connection between telephone exchanges; if the earth stations are in the same country, it is a domestic system.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; satellite earth station - a communications facility with a microwave radio transmitting and receiving antenna and required receiving and transmitting equipment for communicating with satellites.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; satellite link - a radio connection between a satellite and an earth station permitting communication between them, either one-way (down link from satellite to earth station - television receive-only transmission) or two-way (telephone channels).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHF - super high frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000- to 30,000-MHz range.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shortwave - radio frequencies (from 1.605 to 30 MHz) that fall above the commercial broadcast band and are used for communication over long distances.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solidaridad - geosynchronous satellites in Mexico's system of international telecommunications in the Western Hemisphere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statsionar - Russia's geostationary system for satellite telecommunications.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; submarine cable - a cable designed for service under water.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAT - Trans-Atlantic Telephone; any of a number of high-capacity submarine coaxial telephone cables linking Europe with North America. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telefax - facsimile service between subscriber stations via the public switched telephone network or the international Datel network.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telegraph - a telecommunications system designed for unmodulated electric impulse transmission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telex - a communication service involving teletypewriters connected by wire through automatic exchanges.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tropospheric scatter - a form of microwave radio transmission in which the troposphere is used to scatter and reflect a fraction of the incident radio waves back to earth; powerful, highly directional antennas are used to transmit and receive the microwave signals; reliable over-the-horizon communications are realized for distances up to 600 miles in a single hop; additional hops can extend the range of this system for very long distances.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trunk network - a network of switching centers, connected by multichannel trunk lines.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UHF - ultra high frequency; any radio frequency in the 300- to 3,000-MHz range.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VHF - very high frequency; any radio frequency in the 30- to 300-MHz range.</td>

For example, the word <b>Country</b> in the <b>Country name </b>entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states. <b>Military</b> is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense, security, and defense activities in many entries. The <b>Independence</b> entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and former ruling states as well as other significant nationhood dates such as the traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are not strictly independence dates.

The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for population growth in the country. High rates will also place some limits on the labor force participation rates for women. Large numbers of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might limit the ability of the families to feed and educate their children.</td>
