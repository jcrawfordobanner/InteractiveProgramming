The decrease in successful pirate attacks is due, in part, to more aggressive anti-piracy operations by international naval forces as well as the increased use of armed security teams aboard merchant ships. The only exception to this trend was in the Gulf of Guinea, in West Africa, where attacks increased over a wider area in 2012.</article></whatsnew><whatsnew><id>041620131321534530583987494953</id><date>04/18/2013</date><article>Several Military fields have been updated including "Military branches," "Military service age and obligation," and "Military expenditures."</article></whatsnew><whatsnew><id>040920131229029820498913197339</id><date>04/11/2013</date><article>Can you name the five nations with emerging economies whose initials make up the "BRICS countries"?

&#xd;
In light of the importance of the energy sector to the world's economy, the WFB has created a new Energy category. Some of the fields are based on the same entries used previously in the Economy category, but several contain entirely new data and definitions that have not previously appeared in the WFB.&#xd;
&#xd;
The fields for Electricity Flows (production, consumption, exports, and imports) remain the same as before, but there are now five new stock measures for Installed Electricity Generating Capacity, including total installed capacity (measured in kilowatts) and a percentage breakdown of the four main sources of that capacity: fossil fuel plants, nuclear plants, hydroelectric plants, and renewable fuel sources, such as solar and wind.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In the oil sector, former fields have been disaggregated to show separate numbers for crude oil (production, exports, imports, and proven reserves) and refined petroleum products (production, consumption, exports, and imports).  &#xd;
&#xd;
The definitions for each of the five natural gas fields are identical to what had previously appeared in the Economy category. Finally, a new field for "Carbon dioxide emissions from consumption of energy" measures the total output of carbon dioxide from the consumption of all fuels. In total, the new category consists of 23 energy-related fields.&#xd;
&#xd;
The WFB now has 10 broad categories for each of its country entries: Introduction, Geography, People and Society, Government, Economy, Energy, Communications, Transportation, Military, and Transnational Issues.</article></whatsnew><whatsnew><id>100220121151402350813478253629</id><date>10/04/2012</date><article>The People's Republic of China has two Special Administrative Regions, created in 1997 and 1999.

The map also depicts the maritime claims of the littoral states - represented by the buffer line of the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones. Finally, recognizing that around 90% of world trade moves by sea, the map shows a generalization of global shipping lanes and the major cargo and container ports that constitute this vital trading network.&#xd;

In addition to the World Oceans map, The World Factbook recently added 10 new regional political maps to its reference repertoire.
