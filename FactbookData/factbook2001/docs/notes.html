        countries will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite 
        of continued decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility 
        results in an aging population.</p>

    </td>
    <td width="78%" valign=top class="Normal"> 
      <p>This entry lists the most pressing and important environmental problems.  
        The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the entry:</p>
      <p>     acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid precipitation 
        and deposition usually through precipitation; this process disrupts ecosystem 
        nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish and plants dependent on more 
        neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid rain).</p>
      <p>     acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur 
        dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly 
        to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH scale 
        where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered alkaline, and 
        values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note - a pH of 2.4 
        (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in New England.</p>
      <p>     aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, 
        smoke, or fog.</p>
      <p>     afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting 
        trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that 
        have been cut or destroyed by fire. </p>
      <p>     asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used 
        in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in 
        particulate form.</p>
      <p>     biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of 
        species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism, community, 
        and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an ecosystem’s ability 
        to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.</p>
      <p>     bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance, 
        and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.</p>
      <p>     biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given 
        area or volume.</p>
      <p>     carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon 
        (in various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean, 
        terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits. </p>
      <p>     catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and 
        runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited 
        freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.</p>
      <p>     DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless 
        insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was 
        banned in the US in 1972.</p>
      <p>     defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves artificially; 
        often used in agricultural practices for weed control, and may have detrimental 
        impacts on human and ecosystem health.</p>
      <p>     deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g., unsustainable 
        forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing, and the over 
        exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without planting new growth.</p>
      <p>     desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or 
        semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive 
        soils, or climate change.</p>
      <p>     dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, 
        a technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g., 
        shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction 
        of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.</p>
      <p>     drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally 
        anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an 
        over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine 
        species (by-catch) by its effect of “sweeping the ocean clean”.</p>
      <p>     ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of 
        organisms and their specific environments.</p>
      <p>     effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial 
        waste which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting 
        it.</p>
      <p>     endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction 
        either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.</p>
      <p>     freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources 
        include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.</p>
      <p>     greenhouse gas - a gas that “traps” infrared radiation in the lower 
        atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrous 
        oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary greenhouse 
        gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. </p>
      <p>     groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth 
        often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the 
        source for wells and natural springs.</p>
      <p>     Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by 
        Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply into 
        a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest infrastructure 
        project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly and controversial; 
        objections to the project include claims that it forces people from their 
        homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders economic resources.</p>
      <p>     Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 125,000 Inuits 
        of Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental 
        issues; a panel convenes every three years to determine the focus of the 
        ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of pollutants, 
        sustainable development, and climate change.</p>
      <p>     metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science, 
        technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly concentrated 
        and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of ground water and 
        air when not properly disposed.</p>
      <p>     noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.</p>
      <p>     overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than 
        it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, 
        a common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.</p>
      <p>     ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O<sub>3</sub>) 
        that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and absorbs 
        solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living organisms.</p>
      <p>     poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern 
        with respect to endangered or threatened species.</p>
      <p>     pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made 
        waste.</p>
      <p>     potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.</p>
      <p>     salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes 
        salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process; 
        also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by evaporation 
        of excessive irrigation water, a process that can eventually render soil 
        incapable of supporting crops. </p>
      <p>     siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted 
        with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.</p>
      <p>     slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in 
        which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary 
        agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which 
        point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is 
        sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for 
        regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do 
        not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the environment 
        .</p>
      <p>     soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because 
        of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides 
        or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of topsoil, 
        eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce agricultural products.</p>
      <p>     soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind, 
        compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing, 
        and desertification.</p>
      <p>     ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy 
        emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by the 
        ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and has been 
        linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.</p>
      <p>     water-born diseases - those in which the bacteria survive in, and 
        is transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an 
        untreated water supply.</p>

    </td>
    <td width="78%" valign=top class="Normal"> 
      <p>In the <b>Economy </b>section, GDP dollar estimates for all countries 
        are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than 
        from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method involves 
        the use of standardized international dollar price weights, which are 
        applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given 
        economy.  The data derived from the PPP method provide the best available 
        starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between 
        countries.  The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the 
        corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.  
        Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates 
        for developing countries are often rough approximations.  Most of the 
        GDP estimates are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the 
        UN International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers 
        and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. 
        In contrast, the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international 
        and domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic 
        output. In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate 
        estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP 
        estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% 
        or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real output 
        has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14 countries 
        of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to the French 
        franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not 
        cut the real output of these countries by half. One important caution:  
        the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in 
        local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when 
        GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer 
        tries to estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures. 
        Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data can <i>not </i>be chained 
        together from successive volumes of the <i>Factbook</i> because of changes 
        in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, 
        use of new or different sources of information, and changes in national 
        statistical methods and practices.</p>

      <p>     Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.</p>

        includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for 
        those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage 
        is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc. that a ship can 
        carry when immersed to the appropriate load line. GRT or gross register 
        tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered volume 
        of the ship available for cargo and passengers and converting it to tons 
        on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is no stable relationship 
        between GRT and DWT. <i>Ships by type</i> includes a listing of barge 
        carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination

      <p>      A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a territory, 
        possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned 
        in the parent country; it is also referred to as an offshore register, 
        the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive register 
        will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local variant of it, 
        but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore 
        territory. Although the nature of a captive register makes it especially 
        desirable for ships owned in the parent country, just as in the internal 
        register, the ships may also be owned abroad. The captive register then 
        acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it is not the register 
        of an independent state.</p>
      <p>     A flag of convenience register is a national register offering registration 
        to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience 
        (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent 
        taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers 
        are characterized by having relatively few of the registered ships actually 
        owned in the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for 
        ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where 
        the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred 
        to as an open register.</p>
      <p>     A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which 
        holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or 
        abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a ship is 
        crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the 
        register.</p>
      <p>     An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset 
        of a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national 
        flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime 
        rules from those on the main national register. These differences usually 
        include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign nationals as crewmembers, 
        and, usually, ownership outside the flag state (when it functions as an 
        FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship Register and Danish International 
        Ship Register are the most notable examples of an internal register. Both 
        have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags 
        of convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian 
        and Danish flags.</p>
      <p>     A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of 
        freight; it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately 
        restricted to commercial vessels only.</p>
      <p>     A register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as 
        listed with the maritime authorities of a country; also, it is the compendium 
        of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides 
        it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country 
        in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of 
        the ship's ultimate owner.</p>

      <p>Due to the highly structured nature of the <i>Factbook</i> database, 
        some collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word <b>Country</b> 
        in the <b>Country name </b>entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies, 
        areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities 
        in addition to the traditional countries or independent states. <b>Military</b> 
        is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense, security, 
        and defense activities in many entries. The <b>Independence</b> entry 
        includes the usual colonial independence dates and former ruling states 
        as well as other significant nationhood dates such as the traditional 
        founding date or the date of unification, federation, confederation, establishment, 
        or state succession that are not strictly independence dates. Dependent

        than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per woman. This indicator 
        shows the potential for population growth in the country. High rates will 
        also place some limits on the labor force participation rates for women. 
        Large numbers of children born to women indicate large family sizes that
