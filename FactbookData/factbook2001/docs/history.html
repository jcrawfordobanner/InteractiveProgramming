      <p><span>     </span>The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information 
        is acquired, converted into intelligence, and made available to policymakers.  
        Information is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary, 
        contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong.  Intelligence 
        is information that has been collected, integrated, evaluated, analyzed, 
        and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the final product of the Intelligence 
        Cycle ready to be delivered to the policymaker.</p>
      <p>     The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and 
        estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual reference 
        material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports on new developments. 
        Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes. The three are mutually 
        supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation on which the other two 
        are constructed; current intelligence continually updates the  inventory 
        of knowledge; and estimative intelligence revises overall interpretations 
        of country and issue prospects for guidance of basic and  current intelligence. 
        <i>The World Factbook</i>, <i>The President's Daily Brief</i>, and the 
        <i>National Intelligence Estimates</i> are examples of the three types 
        of finished intelligence.</p>
      <p><span>     </span>The United States has carried on foreign intelligence 
        activities since the days of George Washington but only since World War 
        II have they been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs 
        have highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since 
        that time: (1<i>) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies</i> (JANIS), 
        (2<i>) the National Intelligence Survey</i> (NIS), and (3) <i>The World 
        Factbook</i>. </p>
      <p><span>     </span>During World War II, intelligence consumers realized 
        that the production of basic intelligence by different components of the 
        US Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting 
        information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home 
        to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for integrating 
        departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed and coordinated 
        information was needed not only on such major powers as Germany and Japan, 
        but also on places of little previous interest. In the Pacific Theater, 
        for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch amphibious operations 
        against many islands about which information was unconfirmed or nonexistent. 
        Intelligence authorities resolved that the United States should never 
        again be caught unprepared.</p>
      <p><span>     </span>In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train 
        (Office of Naval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director 
        of the Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort 
        should be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 
        that recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing 
        Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the <i>Joint Army Navy 
        Intelligence Studies</i> (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental 
        basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government for 
        an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic intelligence. 
        Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34 JANIS studies. 
        JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous letters of commendation 
        were received, including a statement from Adm. Forrest Sherman, Chief 
        of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said, &quot;JANIS has become the 
        indispensable reference work for the shore-based planners.&quot;</p>
      <p><span>     </span>The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence 
        in the postwar world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a 
        noted author on national security. He wrote in <i>The Future of American 
        Secret Intelligence</i> (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world 
        leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than in 
        war. &quot;The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities 
        - not just the enemy and his war production.&quot;</p>
      <p>     The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 
        and officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October 
        1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational responsibility 
        for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security Council issued Intelligence 
        Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized the <i>National Intelligence 
        Survey</i> (NIS) program as a peacetime replacement for the wartime JANIS 
        program. Before adequate NIS country sections could be produced, government 
        agencies had to develop more comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. 
        The US Board on Geographic Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department 
        of the Interior produced the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.</p>
      <p><span>     </span>The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 
        1954 to study the structure and administration of the CIA, reported to 
        Congress in 1955 that: &quot;The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable 
        publication which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence 
        on all areas of the world.  There will always be a continuing requirement 
        for keeping the Survey up-to-date.&quot; The <i>Factbook</i> was created 
        as an annual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS studies. The first 
        classified <i>Factbook</i> was published in August 1962, and the first 
        unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program was terminated 
        in 1973 except for the <i>Factbook</i>, map, and gazetteer components. 
        The 1975 <i>Factbook</i> was the first to be made available to the public 
        with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The 1996 edition 
        was printed by GPO, and the 1997 edition was reprinted by GPO.  The year 
        2001 marks the 54th anniversary of the establishment of the Central Intelligence 
        Agency and the 58th year of continuous basic intelligence support to the 
        US Government by <i>The World</i> <i>Factbook</i> and its two predecessor 
        programs.</p>
