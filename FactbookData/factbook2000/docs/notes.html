<P> In addition to the updating of information, the following changes have been 
  made in this edition of <I>The World Factbook</I>. There is a new 'country profile' 
  on the Southern Ocean. The name Wake Atoll has been officially changed back 
  to Wake Island. There are new entries on <B>Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</B>, 
  <B>Telephones - main lines in use</B>, and <B>Telephones - mobile cellular</B>. 
  The <B>Background</B> entry, which was introduced in the 1999 edition, has now 
  been completed for over 200 countries. The terms and abbreviations used in the 
  <B>Environment-current issues</B> entry are now explained in the <B>Notes and 
  Definitions </B>section of the prefatory material.<BR>
<P> <B>Abbreviations: </B>This information is included in <B><a href="app-a.html">Appendix 
  A: Abbreviations</a></B>, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used 
  in the <I>Factbook,</I> with their expansions.<BR>

<P> <B>Administrative divisions: </B>This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory 
  terms, and first-order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board 
  on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted 
  on by BGN are noted.<BR>
<P> <B>Age structure: </B>This entry provides the distribution of the population 
  according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 
  15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a population affects a 
  nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations (high percentage 
  under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while countries with older populations 
  (high percentage ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. 
  The age structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues. 
  For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to find employment 
  can lead to unrest.<BR>
<P> <B>Agriculture - products: </B>This entry is a rank ordering of major crops 
  and products starting with the most important.<BR>
<P> <B>Airports: </B>This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s) 
  may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or 
  gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, 
  maintenance, or air traffic control. <BR>
<P> <B>Airports - with paved runways: </B>This entry gives the total number of 
  airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces). For airports with 
  more than one runway, only the longest runway is included according to the following 
  five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, 
  (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are 
  included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, 
  or air traffic control. <BR>
<P> <B>Airports - with unpaved runways:</B> This entry gives the total number 
  of airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces). For 
  airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is included according 
  to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 
  to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable 
  runways are included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, 
  maintenance, or air traffic control.<BR>
<P> <B>Appendixes:</B> This section includes <I>Factbook</I>-related material 
  by topic. <BR>
<P> <B>Area: </B>This entry includes three subfields.<I> Total area</I> is the 
  sum of all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or 
  coastlines. <I>Land area</I> is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international 
  boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, 
  rivers). <I>Water area</I> is the sum of all water surfaces delimited by international 
  boundaries and/or coastlines, including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, 
  rivers).<BR>
<P> <B>Area - comparative:</B> This entry provides an area comparison based on 
  total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one 
  of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US 
  Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC 
  (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 
  146 acres).<BR>
<P> <B>Background:</B> This entry usually highlights major historic events and 
  current issues and may include a statement about one or two key future trends. 
  <BR>
<P> <B>Birth rate: </B>This entry gives the average annual number of births during 
  a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth 
  rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the rate 
  of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility and the age 
  structure of the population. <BR>
<P> <B>Budget: </B>This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital 
  expenditures. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., 
  <U>not</U> in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.<BR>
<P> <B>Capital:</B> This entry gives the location of the seat of government. <BR>
<P> <B>Climate: </B>This entry includes a brief description of typical weather 
  regimes throughout the year.<BR>
<P> <B>Coastline: </B>This entry gives the total length of the boundary between 
  the land area (including islands) and the sea.<BR>
<P> <B>Communications: </B>This category deals with the means of exchanging information 
  and includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet service provider 
  entries.<BR>
<P> <B>Communications - note: </B>This entry includes miscellaneous communications 
  information of significance not included elsewhere.<BR>
<P> <B>Constitution: </B>This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, 
  and major amendments. <BR>
<P> <B>Country map: </B>Most versions of the <I>Factbook </I>provide a country 
  map in color. The maps were produced from the best information available at 
  the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.<BR>
<P> <B>Country name: </B>This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved 
  by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): <I>conventional 
  long form</I> (Italian Republic), <I>conventional short form</I> (Italy), <I>local 
  long form</I> (Repubblica Italiana), <I>local short form</I> (Italia), <I>former</I> 
  (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the <I>abbreviation</I>. Also see the <B>Terminology</B> 
  note.<BR>
<P> <B>Currency: </B>This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and 
  its basic subunit.<BR>
<P> <B>Data code: </B>This entry gives the official US Government digraph that 
  precisely identifies every land entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. 
  AF, for example, is the data code for Afghanistan. This two-letter country code 
  is a standardized geopolitical data element promulgated in the <I>Federal Information 
  Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 10-4</I> by the National Institute of 
  Standards and Technology at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by 
  the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US Department of State. 
  The data code is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, 
  processing, and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful 
  for interchanging data between databases. <B><a href="app-f.html">Appendix F</a>&nbsp;</B>cross-references 
  various country data codes and <B><a href="app-g.html">Appendix G</a> </B>cross-references 
  various hydrographic data codes.<BR>

<P> <B>Data codes - country: </B>This information is presented in <B><a href="app-f.html">Appendix 
  F: Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes</a></B> which includes the US 
  Government approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the 
  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and Internet codes 
  for land entities.<BR>

<P> <B>Data codes - hydrographic: </B>This information is presented in <B><a href="app-g.html">Appendix 
  G: Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes</a></B> which includes the 
  International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart and 
  Information Center (ACIC; now a part of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency 
  or NIMA) codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for hydrographic 
  entities. The US Government has not yet approved a standard for hydrographic 
  data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes.<BR>

<P> <B>Date of information:</B> In general, information available as of 1 January 
  2000, was used in the preparation of this edition.<BR>
<P> <B>Death rate: </B>This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during 
  a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The 
  death rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country, 
  accurately indicates the current mortality impact on population growth. This 
  indicator is significantly affected by age distribution, and most countries 
  will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued 
  decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging 
  population.<BR>
<P> <B>Debt - external: </B>This entry gives the total amount of public foreign 
  financial obligations. <BR>
<P> <B>Dependency status: </B>This entry describes the formal relationship between 
  a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.<BR>
<P> <B>Dependent areas: </B>This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all 
  nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular independent 
  state.<BR>
<P> <B>Diplomatic representation: </B>The US Government has diplomatic relations 
  with 184 independent states, including 181 of the 188 UN members (excluded UN 
  members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia, and the 
  US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 3 independent 
  states that are not in the UN - Holy See, Switzerland, and Tuvalu. <BR>
<P> <B>Diplomatic representation from the US: </B>This entry includes the <I>chief 
  of mission</I>, <I>embassy</I> address, <I>mailing address</I>, <I>telephone</I> 
  number, <I>FAX</I> number, <I>branch office</I> locations, <I>consulate general</I> 
  locations, and <I>consulate</I> locations.<BR>
<P> <B>Diplomatic representation in the US: </B>This entry includes the <I>chief 
  of </I>the foreign <I>mission</I>, <I>chancery</I> address, <I>telephone</I> 
  number, <I>FAX</I> number, <I>consulate general</I> locations, <I>consulate</I> 
  locations, <I>honorary consulate general</I> locations, and <I>honorary consulate</I> 
  locations.<BR>
<P> <B>Disputes - international: </B>This entry includes a wide variety of situations 
  that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims 
  of one sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international terrestrial 
  and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US Department of State. References 
  to other situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such 
  as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, 
  inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition 
  by the US Government.<BR>
<P> <B>Economic aid - donor: </B>This entry refers to net official development 
  assistance (ODA) from OECD nations to developing countries and multilateral 
  organizations. ODA is defined as financial assistance that is concessional in 
  character, has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare 
  of the less developed countries (LDCs), and contains a grant element of at least 
  25%. The entry does not cover other official flows (OOF) or private flows.<BR>
<P> <B>Economic aid - recipient: </B>This entry, which is subject to major problems 
  of definition and statistical coverage, refers to the net inflow of Official 
  Development Finance (ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance 
  from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international organizations and from 
  individual nation donors. Formal commitments of aid are included in the data. 
  Omitted from the data are grants by private organizations. Aid comes in various 
  forms including outright grants and loans. The entry thus is the difference 
  between new inflows and repayments.<BR>
<P> <B>Economy: </B>This category includes the entries dealing with the size, 
  development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor, and 
  capital.<BR>
<P> <B>Economy - overview: </B>This entry briefly describes the type of economy, 
  including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic development, 
  the most important natural resources, and the unique areas of specialization. 
  It also characterizes major economic events and policy changes in the most recent 
  12 months and may include a statement about one or two key future macroeconomic 
  trends.<BR>
<P> <B>Electricity - consumption: </B>This entry consists of total electricity 
  generated annually plus imports and minus exports, expressed in kilowatt hours. 
  The discrepancy between the amount of electricity generated and/or imported 
  and the amount consumed and/or exported is accounted for as loss in transmission 
  and distribution.<BR>
<P> <B>Electricity - exports: </B>This entry is the total exported electricity 
  in kilowatt hours.<BR>
<P> <B>Electricity - imports: </B>This entry is the total imported electricity 
  in kilowatt hours.<BR>
<P> <B>Electricity - production: </B>This entry is the annual electricity generated 
  expressed in kilowatt hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity 
  generated and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is accounted 
  for as loss in transmission and distribution.<BR>
<P> <B>Electricity - production by source:</B> This entry indicates the percentage 
  share of annual electricity production of each energy source. These are fossil 
  fuel, hydro, nuclear, and other (solar, geothermal, and wind).<BR>
<P> <B>Elevation extremes: </B>This entry includes both the <I>highest point</I> 
  and the <I>lowest point</I>.<BR>
<P> <B>Entities: </B>Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of special 
  sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not independent, 
  and others are not officially recognized by the US Government. &quot;Independent 
  state&quot; refers to a people politically organized into a sovereign state 
  with a definite territory. &quot;Dependencies&quot; and &quot;areas of special 
  sovereignty&quot; refer to a broad category of political entities that are associated 
  in some way with an independent state. &quot;Country&quot; names used in the 
  table of contents or for page headings are usually the short-form names as approved 
  by the US Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states, dependencies, 
  and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic entities. There are a 
  total of 267 separate geographic entities in <I>The World Factbook</I> that 
  may be categorized as follows:<BR>

<P> <B>Environment - current issues: </B>This entry lists the most pressing and 
  important environmental problems. The following terms and abbreviations are 
  used throughout the entry:<BR>
<P> <i>acidification</i> - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid precipitation 
  and deposition; this process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill 
  freshwater fish and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions 
  (see acid rain). 
<P> <i>acid rain</i> &#173; characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur 
  dioxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly to the earth's fragile 
  ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH scale where 7 is neutral, values 
  greater that 7 are considered alkaline, and anything measured below 5.6 is considered 
  acid precipitation; note - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured 
  in rainfall in New England. 
<P> <i>asbestos</i> &#173; a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly 
  used in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic. 
<P> <i>biodiversity</i> - also biological diversity; many species, diverse in 
  form and function, at the genetic, organism, community, and ecosystem level; 
  loss of biodiversity reduces an ecosystem's ability to recover from natural 
  or man-induced disruption. 
<P> <i>catchments</i> &#173; assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater 
  and runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited freshwater 
  resources, such as Gibraltar. 
<P> <i>DDT (dichloro&#173;diphenyl&#173;trichloro&#173;ethane)</i> &#173; a colorless, 
  odorless insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT 
  was banned in the US in 1972. 
<P> <i>defoliants</i> &#173; chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves 
  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control, and may 
  have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health. 
<P> <i>deforestation</i> &#173; the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g., 
  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing, and 
  the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without planting new 
  growth. 
<P> <i>desertification</i> - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-arid 
  areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive soils, or climate 
  change. 
<P> <i>dredging</i> - in general, the practice of deepening an existing waterway; 
  more specifically, a technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms 
  (e.g., shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction 
  of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems. 
<P> <i>drift&#173;net fishing</i> &#173; done with a net, miles in extent, that 
  is generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results 
  in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine 
  species (by-catch) by its effect of &quot;sweeping the ocean clean&quot;. 
<P> <i>ecosystems</i> &#173; ecological units comprised of complex communities 
  of organisms and their specific environments. 
<P> <i>effluents</i> &#173; waste materials, such as smoke or sewage, which are 
  released into the environment, subsequently polluting it. 
<P> <i>endangered species</i> &#173; a species that is threatened with extinction 
  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction. 
<P> <i>freshwater</i> - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources include 
  lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers. 
<P> <i>groundwater</i> - water sources found below the surface of the earth often 
  in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source for wells 
  and natural springs. 
<P> <i>Highlands Water Project</i> &#173; a series of dams constructed jointly 
  by Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply into 
  a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest infrastructure 
  project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly and controversial; objections 
  to the project include claims that it forces people from their homes, submerges 
  farmlands, and squanders economic resources. 
<P> <i>Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC)</i> &#173; represents the 125,000 Inuits 
  of Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental issues; 
  a panel convenes every three years to determine the focus of the ICC; the most 
  current concerns are long&#173;range transport of pollutants, sustainable development, 
  and climate change. 
<P> <i>metallurgical plants</i> &#173; industries which specialize in the science, 
  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly concentrated 
  and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of ground water and air when 
  not properly disposed. 
<P> <i>noxious substances</i> &#173; injurious, very harmful to living beings. 
<P> <i>overgrazing &#173;</i> the grazing of animals on plant material faster 
  than it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a 
  common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land. 
<P> <i>ozone shield</i> &#173; a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas 
  (O<SUB>3</SUB>) that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface 
  and absorbs solar ultra&#173;violet radiation that can be harmful to living 
  organisms. 
<P> <i>poaching</i> &#173; the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern 
  with respect to endangered or threatened species. 
<P> <i>pollution</i> &#173; the contamination of a healthy environment by man&#173;made 
  waste. 
<P> <i>potable water</i> &#173; water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed. 
<P> <i>salination</i> - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes 
  salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process. 
<P> <i>siltation</i> &#173; occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted 
  with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion. 
<P> <i>slash&#173;and&#173;burn agriculture</i> - a rotating cultivation technique 
  in which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary 
  agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which point 
  a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is sustainable 
  while population levels are low and time is permitted for regrowth of natural 
  vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do not exist, the practice can 
  have disastrous consequences for the environment . 
<P> <i>soil degradation</i> &#173; damage to the land's productive capacity because 
  of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, 
  soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of top soil, eventually resulting 
  in reduced ability to produce agricultural products. 
<P> <i>soil erosion</i> - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind, 
  compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing, and desertification. 
<P> <i>ultra&#173;violet (UV) radiation</i> - a portion of the electromagnetic

<P> <B>Environment - international agreements: </B>This entry separates country 
  participation in international environmental agreements into two levels - <I>party 
  to</I> and <I>signed but not ratified</I>. Agreements are listed in alphabetical 
  order by the abbreviated form of the full name. <BR>
<P> <B>Environmental agreements: </B>This information is presented in <B><a href="app-d.html">Appendix 
  D: Selected International Environmental Agreements</a></B>, which includes the 
  name, abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into force, objective,

  of total dollar value.<BR>
<P> <B>Fiscal year: </B>This entry identifies the beginning and ending months 
  for a country's accounting period of 12 months, which often is the calendar 
  year but which may begin in any month. All yearly references are for the calendar 
  year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).<BR>
<P> <B>Flag description: </B>This entry provides a written flag description produced 
  from actual flags or the best information available at the time the entry was 
  written. The flags of independent states are used by their dependencies unless 
  there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas 
  do not have flags.<BR>
<P> <B>Flag graphic:</B> Most versions of the <I>Factbook </I>include a color 
  flag at the beginning of the country profile. The flag graphics were produced 
  from actual flags or the best information available at the time of preparation. 
  The flags of independent states are used by their dependencies unless there 
  is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas do not 
  have flags.<BR>
<P> <B>GDP: </B>This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of 
  all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP dollar 
  estimates in the <I>Factbook </I>are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) 
  calculations. See the note on <B>GDP methodology </B>for more information.<BR>
<P> <B>GDP methodology: </B>In the <B>Economy </B>section, GDP dollar estimates 
  for all countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations 
  rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method 
  involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights, which are 
  applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy. 
  The data derived from the PPP method provide the best available starting point 
  for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries. The division 
  of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in 
  dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries 
  are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations. 
  Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers published 
  by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert 
  Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. 
  In contrast, the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international 
  and domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output. 
  In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP 
  in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, 
  exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces 
  or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, 
  for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies 
  are tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of 
  course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One important 
  caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP 
  in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when 
  GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries 
  to estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: 
  the numbers for GDP and other economic data can <I>not </I>be chained together 
  from successive volumes of the <I>Factbook</I> because of changes in the US 
  dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new 
  or different sources of information, and changes in national statistical methods 
  and practices. <BR>
<P> <B>GDP - composition by sector: </B>This entry gives the percentage contribution 
  of <I>agriculture</I>, <I>industry</I>, and <I>services</I> to total GDP.<BR>
<P> <B>GDP - per capita: </B>This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity 
  basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.<BR>
<P> <B>GDP - real growth rate: </B>This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis 
  adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent.<BR>
<P> <B>Geographic coordinates: </B>This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude 
  figures for the purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity 
  and is based on the <I>Gazetteer of Conventional Names</I>, Third Edition, August 
  1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.<BR>
<P> <B>Geographic names:</B> This information is presented in <B><a href="app-h.html">Appendix 
  H: Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names</a></B> which indicates where various 
  geographic names - including alternate names, former names, political or geographical 
  portions of larger entities, and the location of all US Foreign Service posts 
  - can be found in <I>The World Factbook</I>. Spellings are normally, but not 
  always, those approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate 
  names are included in parentheses, while additional information is included 
  in brackets. <BR>
<P> <B>Geography:</B> This category includes the entries dealing with the natural 
  environment and the effects of human activity.<BR>

<P> <B>Geography - note: </B>This entry includes miscellaneous geographic information 
  of significance not included elsewhere.<BR>
<P> <B>GNP: </B>Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and 
  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned by its 
  citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production. 
  The <I>Factbook</I>, following current practice,<I> </I>uses GDP rather than 
  GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize that in certain 
  countries net remittances from citizens working abroad may be important to national 
  well-being. <BR>
<P> <B>Government:</B> This category includes the entries dealing with the system 
  for the adoption and administration of public policy.<BR>
<P> <B>Government type: </B>This entry gives the basic form of government (e.g.,

  <BR>
<P> <B>Household income or consumption by percentage share:</B> Data on household 
  income or consumption come from household surveys, the results adjusted for 
  household size. Nations use different standards and procedures in collecting 
  and adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will normally show a more unequal 
  distribution than surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving 
  with time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country comparisons.<BR>
<P> <B>Illicit drugs: </B>This entry gives information on the five categories 
  of illicit drugs - narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, 
  and cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed 
  by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold outside of medical channels. 
<P> Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides hallucinogens 
  with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, 
  reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil 
  (hash oil). 
<P> Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the stimulant 
  used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from 
  cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter. 
<P> Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush. 
<P> Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include 
  chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital), benzodiazepines 
  (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others 
  (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid). 
<P> Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional, 
  or behavioral change in an individual. 
<P> Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results 
  in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual. 
<P> Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and 
  emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, 
  buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, 
  angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, 
  psilocyn). 
<P> Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa). 
<P> Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine. 
<P> Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant. 
<P> Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa). 
<P> Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in Southwest 
  Asia. 
<P> Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium, 
  opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium 
  (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with 
  codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics 
  include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics 
  include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), 
  and others (Darvon, Lomotil). 
<P> Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium 
  poppy. 
<P> Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and semisynthetic 
  narcotics. 
<P> Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature, dried opium 
  poppy. 
<P> Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis that 
  is chewed or drunk as tea. 
<P> Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical 
  depressant. 
<P> Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and activity, 
  and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), 
  ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor, Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), 
  methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate). <BR>

<P> <B>Independence:</B> For most countries, this entry gives the date that sovereignty 
  was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For the other countries, 
  the date given may not represent &quot;independence&quot; in the strict sense, 
  but rather some significant nationhood event such as the traditional founding 
  date or the date of unification, federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental 
  change in the form of government, or state succession. Dependent areas include 
  the notation &quot;none&quot; followed by the nature of their dependency status.

<P> <B>Introduction:</B> This category includes one entry, <B>Background</B>. 
  <BR>

<P> <B>Irrigated land: </B>This entry gives the number of square kilometers of 
  land area that is artificially supplied with water.<BR>
<P> <B>Judicial branch: </B>This entry contains the name(s) of the highest court(s) 
  and a brief description of the selection process for members.<BR>
<P> <B>Labor force: </B>This entry contains the total labor force figure.<BR>
<P> <B>Labor force - by occupation: </B>This entry contains a rank ordering of 
  component parts of the labor force by occupation.<BR>
<P> <B>Land boundaries: </B>This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries 
  and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries. <BR>
<P> <B>Land use: </B>This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area 
  for five different types of land use: <I>arable land</I> - land cultivated for 
  crops that are replanted after each harvest like wheat, maize, and rice; <I>permanent 
  crops</I> - land cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each harvest 
  like citrus, coffee, and rubber; <I>permanent pastures</I> - land permanently 
  used for herbaceous forage crops; <I>forests and woodland</I> - land under dense 
  or open stands of trees; <I>other</I> - any land type not specifically mentioned 
  above, such as urban areas, roads, desert, etc.<BR>
<P> <B>Languages: </B>This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting 
  with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population speaking 
  that language.<BR>
<P> <B>Legal system: </B>This entry contains a brief description of the legal 
  system's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of International 
  Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.<BR>
<P> <B>Legislative branch: </B>This entry contains information on the structure 
  (unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and term 
  of office. <I>Elections</I> includes the nature of election process or accession 
  to power, date of the last election, and date of the next election. <I>Election 
  results</I> includes the percent of vote and/or number of seats held by each 
  party in the last election. <BR>
<P> <B>Life expectancy at birth: </B>This entry contains the average number of 
  years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if mortality at 
  each age remains constant in the future. The entry includes total population 
  as well as the male and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also 
  a measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the mortality 
  at all ages. It can also be thought of as indicating the potential return on 
  investment in human capital and is necessary for the calculation of various 
  actuarial measures. <BR>
<P> <B>Literacy: </B>This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau 
  percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are no universal 
  definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise specified, all rates 
  are based on the most common definition - the ability to read and write at a 
  specified age. Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess 
  the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of the <I>Factbook</I>. Information 
  on literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably 
  the most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels 
  of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development of 
  a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.<BR>
<P> <B>Location: </B>This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring 
  countries, and adjacent bodies of water.<BR>
<P> <B>Map references: </B>This entry includes the name of the <I>Factbook </I>reference 
  map on which a country may be found. The entry on <B>Geographic coordinates 
  </B>may be helpful in finding some smaller countries. <BR>
<P> <B>Maritime claims: </B>This entry includes the following claims: contiguous 
  zone, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone, exclusive fishing zone, extended 
  fishing zone, none (usually for a landlocked country), other (unique maritime 
  claims like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line or North Korea's Military Boundary 
  Line), and territorial sea. The proximity of neighboring states may prevent 
  some national claims from being extended the full distance.<BR>
<P> <B>Merchant marine: </B>Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged 
  in the carriage of goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary 
  ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a 
  grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register. This entry contains information 
  in two subfields - <I>total</I> and <I>ships by type</I>. <I>Total</I> includes 
  the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for those ships, and 
  total GRT for those ships. <I>Ships by type</I> includes a listing of barge 
  carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo ships, combination bulk carriers, combination 
  ore/oil carriers, container ships, intermodal ships, liquefied gas tankers, 
  livestock carriers, multifunction large-load carriers, oil tankers, passenger 
  ships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off 
  cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships, specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, 
  and vehicle carriers. 
<P> A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, 
  or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent 
  country; it is also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent 
  of an internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag 
  as the parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the 
  maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature 
  of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent 
  country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad. 
  The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that 
  it is not the register of an independent state. 
<P> A flag of convenience register is a national register offering registration 
  to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience 
  (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent 
  taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are 
  characterized by having relatively few of the registered ships actually owned 
  in the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under 
  a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the 
  merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register. 
<P> A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal 
  jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Maritime 
  legislation of the flag state determines how a ship is crewed and taxed and 
  whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register. 
<P> An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of a national 
  register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that 
  nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on 
  the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation 
  of profits, use of foreign nationals as crew members, and, usually, ownership 
  outside the flag state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian 
  International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most 
  notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming 
  flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreign-owned 
  ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags. 
<P> A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; 
  it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted 
  to commercial vessels only. 
<P> A register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with 
  the maritime authorities of a country; also, it is the compendium of such individual 
  ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality 
  and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag 
  state) regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.<BR>
<P> <B>Military: </B>This category includes the entries dealing with a country's 
  military structure, manpower, and expenditures.<BR>
<P> <B>Military branches: </B>This entry lists the names of the ground, naval, 
  air, marine, and other defense or security forces.<BR>
<P> <B>Military expenditures - dollar figure: </B>This entry gives current military 
  expenditures in US dollars; the figure is calculated by multiplying the estimated 
  defense spending in percentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP) calculated 
  on an exchange rate basis <I><B>not</B></I> purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. 
  However, in the case of Russia, estimates of military expenditures have been 
  made using PPP. Dollar figures for military expenditures should be treated with 
  caution because of different price patterns and accounting methods among nations, 
  as well as wide variations in the strength of their currencies. <BR>
<P> <B>Military expenditures - percent of GDP: </B>This entry gives current military 
  expenditures as an estimated percent of gross domestic product (GDP).<BR>
<P> <B>Military manpower - availability: </B>This entry gives the total numbers 
  of males and females age 15-49 and assumes that every individual is fit to serve.<BR>
<P> <B>Military manpower - fit for military service: </B>This entry gives the 
  number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military service. This is a more 
  refined measure of potential military manpower availability which tries to correct 
  for the health situation in the country and reduces the maximum potential number 
  to a more realistic estimate of the actual number fit to serve.<BR>
<P> <B>Military manpower - military age: </B>This entry gives the minimum age 
  at which an individual may volunteer for military service or be subject to conscription.<BR>
<P> <B>Military manpower - reaching military age annually: </B>This entry gives 
  the number of draft-age males and females entering the military manpower pool 
  in any given year and is a measure of the availability of draft-age young adults.<BR>
<P> <B>Military - note: </B>This entry includes miscellaneous military information 
  of significance not included elsewhere.<BR>
<P> <B>Money figures: </B>All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US 
  dollars unless otherwise indicated.<BR>
<P> <B>National holiday: </B>This entry gives the primary national day of celebration 
  - usually independence day.<BR>
<P> <B>Nationality: </B>This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens 
  - <I>noun</I> and <I>adjective</I>.<BR>
<P> <B>Natural hazards: </B>This entry lists potential natural disasters.<BR>
<P> <B>Natural resources: </B>This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, 
  hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.<BR>
<P> <B>Net migration rate: </B>This entry includes the figure for the difference 
  between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year 
  per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering 
  the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56 migrants/1,000 population); 
  an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 
  population). The net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration 
  to the overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause 
  problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people 
  are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain key sectors 
  (if people are leaving). <BR>
<P> <B>People: </B>This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics 
  of the people and their society.<BR>

<P> <B>People - note: </B>This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information 
  of significance not included elsewhere.<BR>
<P> <B>Personal Names - Capitalization:</B> The <I>Factbook </I>capitalizes the 
  surname or family name of individuals for the convenience of our users who are 
  faced with a world of different cultures and naming conventions. An example 
  would be President SADDAM Husayn of Iraq. Saddam is <U>his</U> name and Husayn 
  is his father's name. He may be referred to as President SADDAM Husayn or President 
  SADDAM, but <B>not</B> President Husayn. The need for capitalization, bold type, 
  underlining, italics, or some other indicator of the individual's surname is 
  apparent in the following examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, William Jefferson 
  CLINTON, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin 
  Alam Shah. By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital letters 
  can be used with confidence as in President Saddam, President Castro, Chairman 
  Mao, President Clinton, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin. The same system of capitalization 
  is extended to the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly used 
  such as Queen ELIZABETH II. <BR>
<P> <B>Personal Names - Spelling: </B>The romanization of personal names in the 
  <I>Factbook </I>normally follows the same transliteration system used by the 
  US Board on Geographic Names for spelling place names. At times, however, a 
  foreign leader expressly indicates a preference for, or the media or official 
  documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the transliteration 
  derived from the US Government standard. In such cases, the <I>Factbook</I> 
  uses the alternative spelling.<BR>
<P> <B>Personal Names - Titles: </B>The <I>Factbook </I>capitalizes any valid 
  title (or short form of it) immediately preceding a person's name. A title standing 
  alone is lowercased. Examples: President PUTIN and President CLINTON are chiefs 
  of state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier is the 
  head of the government, while in the US, the president is both chief of state 
  and head of government. <BR>
<P> <B>Pipelines: </B>This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for 
  transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.<BR>
<P> <B>Political parties and leaders: </B>This entry includes a listing of significant 
  political organizations and their leaders.<BR>
<P> <B>Political pressure groups and leaders: </B>This entry includes a listing 
  of organizations with leaders involved in politics, but not standing for legislative 
  election.<BR>
<P> <B>Population: </B>This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the 
  Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration 
  systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on assumptions 
  about future trends. The total population presents one overall measure of the 
  potential impact of the country on the world and within its region. Note: starting 
  with the 1993 <I>Factbook</I>, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly 
  African) have explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact 
  of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin, 
  Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central 
  African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote 
  d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, 
  Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, 
  Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. <BR>
<P> <B>Population below poverty line: </B>National estimates of the percentage 
  of the population lying below the poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, 
  with the results weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions 
  of poverty vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally 
  employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations. <BR>
<P> <B>Population growth rate: </B>The average annual percent change in the population, 
  resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance 
  of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. 
  The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be imposed 
  on a country by the changing needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, 
  hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and 
  jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.<BR>
<P> <B>Ports and harbors: </B>This entry lists the major ports and harbors selected 
  on the basis of overall importance to each country. This is determined by evaluating 
  a number of factors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage, facilities, 
  military significance).<BR>
<P> <B>Radio broadcast stations: </B>This entry includes the total number of AM, 
  FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.<BR>
<P> <B>Radios: </B>This entry gives the total number of radio receivers.<BR>
<P> <B>Railways: </B>This entry includes the <I>total </I>route length of the 
  railway network and component parts by gauge: <I>broad</I>, <I>dual</I>, <I>narrow</I>, 
  <I>standard</I>, and<I> other</I>.<BR>
<P> <B>Reference maps: </B>This section includes world, regional, and special 
  or current interest maps. <BR>

<P> <B>Religions: </B>This entry includes a rank ordering of religions by adherents 
  starting with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total 
  population.<BR>
<P> <B>Sex ratio: </B>This entry includes the number of males for each female 
  in five age groups - <I>at birth</I>, <I>under 15 years</I>, <I>15-64 years</I>, 
  <I>65 years and over</I>, and for the <I>total population</I>. Sex ratio at 
  birth has recently emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination 
  in some countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries 
  are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong 
  preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and fertility 
  patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest among young adult males who are unable 
  to find partners.<BR>
<P> <B>Suffrage: </B>This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the 
  right to vote is universal or restricted.<BR>
<P> <B>Telephone numbers: </B>All telephone numbers in the <I>Factbook</I> consist 
  of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, 
  and the local number. The one component that is not presented is the international 
  access code, which varies from country to country. For example, an international 
  direct dial telephone call placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as 
  follows:<BR>
<P> 011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx, where 
<P> 011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls 
<P> (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls), 
<P> [34] is the country code for Spain, 
<P> (1) is the city code for Madrid, 
<P> 577 is the local exchange, and 
<P> xxxx is the local telephone number.<BR>
<P> An international direct dial telephone call placed from another country to 
  the US would be as follows: <BR>
<P> international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where 
<P> [1] is the country code for the US, 
<P> (202) is the area code for Washington, DC, 
<P> 939 is the local exchange, and 
<P> xxxx is the local telephone number.<BR>
<P> <B>Telephone system: </B>This entry includes a brief characterization of the 
  system with details on the <I>domestic</I> and <I>international</I> components.

<P> <B>Telephones - main lines in use: </B>This entry gives the total number of 
  main telephone lines in use.<BR>
<P> <B>Telephones - mobile cellular</B>: This entry gives the total number of 
  mobile cellular telephones in use.<BR>
<P> <B>Television - broadcast stations: </B>This entry gives the total number 
  of separate broadcast stations plus any repeater stations.<BR>
<P> <B>Televisions: </B>This entry gives the total number of television sets.<BR>
<P> <B>Terminology:</B> Due to the highly structured nature of the <I>Factbook</I> 
  database, some collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word 
  <B>Country</B> in the <B>Country name </B>entry refers to a wide variety of 
  dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities 
  in addition to the traditional countries or independent states. <B>Military</B> 
  is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense, security, and defense 
  activities in many entries. The <B>Independence</B> entry includes the usual 
  colonial independence dates and former ruling states as well as other significant 
  nationhood dates such as the traditional founding date or the date of unification, 
  federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are not strictly 
  independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency status 
  noted in this same entry.<BR>
<P> <B>Terrain: </B>This entry contains a brief description of the topography.<BR>
<P> <B>Total fertility rate: </B>This entry gives a figure for the average number 
  of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their 
  childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at 
  each age. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of the level of 
  fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per woman. This 
  indicator shows the potential for population growth in the country. High rates 
  will also place some limits on the labor force participation rates for women. 
  Large numbers of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might 
  limit the ability of the families to feed and educate their children. <BR>
<P> <B>Transnational Issues:</B> This category includes only two entries at the 
  present time - <B>Disputes - international</B> and <B>Illicit drugs</B> - that 
  deal with current issues going beyond national boundaries.<BR>
<P> <B>Transportation: </B>This category includes the entries dealing with the 
  means for movement of people and goods.<BR>
<P> <B>Transportation - note: </B>This entry includes miscellaneous transportation 
  information of significance not included elsewhere.<BR>
<P> <B>Unemployment rate: </B>This entry contains the percent of the labor force 
  that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.<BR>
<P> <B>United Nations System: </B>This information is presented in <B><a href="app-b.html">Appendix 
  B: United Nations System</a> </B>as a chart, table, or text (depending on the 
  version of the <I>Factbook</I>) that shows the organization of the UN in detail. 
  <BR>

<P> <B>Waterways: </B>This entry gives the total length and individual names of 
  navigable rivers, canals, and other inland bodies of water.<BR>
<P> <B>Weights and measures: </B>This information is presented in <B><a href="app-e.html">Appendix 
  E: Weights and Measures</a></B> and includes mathematical notations (mathematical 
  powers and names), metric interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length, weight, 
  or capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.<BR>

<P> <B>Years: </B>All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated 
  as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting period of 12 months 
  from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is an accounting period of 12 
  months other than 1 January to 31 December. <BR>
