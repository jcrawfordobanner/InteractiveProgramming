      <span class="category_data">Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery, involving victims who are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual exploitation. The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN agency charged with addressing labor standards, employment, and social protection issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are enslaved in forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual servitude, and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human trafficking is a multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown, inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000, the US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the US to combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad. One of the law's key components is the creation of the US Department of State's annual <em>Trafficking in Persons Report</em>, which assesses the government response (i.e., the <em>current situation</em>) in some 150 countries with a significant number of victims trafficked across their borders who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained for forced labor or sexual exploitation.
Countries in the annual report are rated in three tiers, based on government efforts to combat trafficking. The countries identified in this entry are those listed in the <em>2010 Trafficking in Persons Report</em> as <em>Tier 2 Watch List</em> or <em>Tier 3</em> based on the following <em>tier rating</em> definitions:

<br><b>Tier 2 Watch  List</b> <em>countries do not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making significant efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:
<br>1. 	they display high  or  significantly  increasing  number of  victims, 
<br>2. 	they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat trafficking in persons, or, 
<br>3. they have committed to take action over the next year.</em>

<br><b>Tier 3</b>  <em>countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to do so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential non-humanitarian and non-trade sanctions.</em></span></td>
